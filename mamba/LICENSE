(vi)           Licensee shall not distribute, sublicense or disclose source code of Licensed Software to any third party (provided however that Licensee may appoint employee(s) of Contractors as Designated Users to use Licensed Software pursuant to this Agreement).

(viii)      Licensee shall not and shall cause that its Affiliates or Contractors shall not use Licensed Software in any Prohibited Combination, unless Licensee has received an advance written permission from The Mamba Company to do so. Absent such written permission, any and all distribution by the Licensee during the Term of a hardware device or product a) which incorporate or integrate any part of Licensed Software or Open Source Mamba; or b) where the main user interface or substantial functionality is provided by software built with Licensed Software or Open Source Mamba or otherwise depends on the Licensed Software or Open Source Mamba, shall be considered to be Device distribution under this Agreement and shall be dependent on Licensee’s compliance thereof (including but not limited to obligation to pay applicable License Fees for such distribution). Notwithstanding what is provided above in this sub-section (viii), Licensee is entitled to use and combine Licensed Software with any Permitted Software;<br><br>

(ix)           Licensee shall cause all of its Affiliates and Contractors entitled to make use of the licenses granted under this Agreement, to be contractually bound to comply with the relevant terms of this Agreement and not to use the Licensed Software beyond the terms hereof and for any purposes other than operating within the scope of their services for Licensee.

Any use of Licensed Software beyond the provisions of this Agreement is strictly prohibited and requires an additional license from The Mamba Company.
<h1>4.     THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE</h1>

The Licensed Software may provide links to third party libraries or code (collectively "Third-Party Software") to implement various functions. Third-Party Software does not comprise part of the Licensed Software. In some cases, access to Third-Party Software may be included with the Licensed Software. Such Third-Party Software will be documented in the Licensed Software, as such may be amended from time to time. Licensee acknowledges that use or distribution of Third-Party Software is in all respects subject to applicable license terms of applicable third-party right holders.
<h1>5.     PRE-RELEASE CODE</h1>

The Licensed Software may contain pre-release code and functionality, or sample code marked or otherwise stated with appropriate designation such as “Technology Preview”, “Alpha”, “Beta”, “Sample” etc. (“Pre-Release Code”).<br><br>

Such Pre-Release Code may be present complimentary for the Licensee, in order to provide experimental support or information for new platforms or preliminary versions of one or more new functionalities or for other similar reasons. The Pre-Release Code may not be at the level of performance and compatibility of a final, generally available, product offering.  The Pre-Release Code may not operate correctly, may contain errors and may be substantially modified by The Mamba Company prior to the first commercial product release, if any. The Mamba Company is under no obligation to make Pre-Release Code commercially available, or provide any Support or Updates relating thereto. The Mamba Company assumes no liability whatsoever regarding any Pre-Release Code, but any use thereof is exclusively at Licensee’s own risk and expense.<br><br>

For clarity, unless Licensed Software specifies different license terms for the respective Pre-Release Code, the Licensee is entitled to use such pre-release code pursuant to Section 3, just like other Licensed Software, provided however that in the event Add-on Products are included and available as such Pre-Release Code, Licensee’s right to use such Add-on Products is nevertheless subject to and conditional upon conclusion of separate agreement with The Mamba Company.
<h1>6.     LIMITED WARRANTY AND WARRANTY DISCLAIMER</h1>

The Mamba Company hereby represents and warrants that it has the power and authority to grant the rights and licenses granted to Licensee under this Agreement.<br><br>

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE MAMBA COMPANY ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS LICENSORS, SUPPLIERS AND AFFILIATES, DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT WITH REGARD TO THE LICENSED SOFTWARE.

EXCEPT FOR (I) CASES OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT,  AND (II) BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AGGREGATE LICENSE FEES PAID OR PAYABLE TO THE MAMBA COMPANY FROM LICENSEE DURING THE PERIOD OF TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT RESULTING IN SUCH LIABILITY.<br><br>

THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 7 ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE MAMBA COMPANY AND LICENSEE AND THE PARTIES HAVE RELIED UPON THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH HEREIN IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.<br><br>

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, LICENSEE SHALL ALWAYS BE LIABLE TO PAY THE APPLICABLE LICENSE FEES CORRESPONDING TO ITS ACTUAL USE OF LICENSED SOFTWARE.
<h1>8.     SUPPORT, UPDATES AND ONLINE SERVICES</h1>

Upon due payment of the agreed License Fees the Licensee will be eligible to receive Support and Updates and to use the Online Services during the License Term, provided, however, that in the event the License Term is longer than 36 months, the initial payment includes Support for only the first 12 months, unless the Parties specifically otherwise agree.<br><br>

Unless otherwise decided by The Company at its free and absolute discretion, Upgrades will not be included in the Support but may be available subject to additional fees.<br><br>

From time to time The Mamba Company may change the Support terms, provided that during the respective ongoing License Term the level of Support provided by The Mamba Company may not be reduced without the consent of the Licensee.<br><br>

Each Party acknowledges that during the Term of this Agreement each Party may receive information about the other Party's business, business methods, business plans, customers, business relations, technology, and other information, including the terms of this Agreement, that is confidential and of great value to the other Party, and the value of which would be significantly reduced if disclosed to third parties (“Confidential Information”). Accordingly, when a Party (the “Receiving Party”) receives Confidential Information from the other Party (the “Disclosing Party”), the Receiving Party shall only disclose such information to employees and Contractors on a need to know basis, and shall cause its employees and employees of its Affiliates to: (i) maintain any and all Confidential Information in confidence; (ii) not disclose the Confidential Information to a third party without the Disclosing Party's prior written approval; and (iii) not, directly or indirectly, use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than for exercising its rights and fulfilling its responsibilities pursuant to this Agreement. Each Party shall take reasonable measures to protect the Confidential Information of the other Party, which measures shall not be less than the measures taken by such Party to protect its own confidential and proprietary information.<br><br>

Obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to information that (i) is or becomes generally known to the public through no act or omission of the Receiving Party; (ii) was in the Receiving Party's lawful possession prior to the disclosure hereunder and was not subject to limitations on disclosure or use; (iii) is developed independently by employees or Contractors of the Receiving Party or other persons working for the Receiving Party who have not had access to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, as proven by the written records of the Receiving Party; (iv) is lawfully disclosed to the Receiving Party without restrictions, by a third party not under an obligation of confidentiality; or (v) the Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose, in which case the Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party of such compelled disclosure and assert the privileged and confidential nature of the information and cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party to limit the scope of disclosure and the dissemination of disclosed Confidential Information to the minimum extent necessary.<br><br>

The obligations under this Section 9 shall continue to remain in force for a period of five (5) years after the last disclosure, and, with respect to trade secrets, for so long as such trade secrets are protected under applicable trade secret laws.

<h2>11.2.               The Mamba Company’s Audit Rights</h2>

The Mamba Company or an independent auditor acting on behalf of The Mamba Company’s, may, upon at least five (5) business days’ prior written notice and at its expense, audit Licensee with respect to the Licensee’s use of the Licensed Software, but not more frequently than once during each 6-month period. Such audit may be conducted by mail, electronic means or through an in-person visit to Licensee’s place of business. Any such in-person audit shall be conducted during regular business hours at Licensee's facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere with Licensee's business activities. The Mamba Company or the independent auditor acting on behalf of The Mamba Company shall be entitled to inspect Licensee’s Records and conduct necessary interviews of Licensee’s relevant employees and Contractors.

In addition, in the event the audit reveals a material violation of the terms of this Agreement (without limitation, either (i) underpayment of more than 10 % of License Fees or 10,000 euros (whichever is more) or (ii) distribution of products, which include or result from Prohibited Combination, shall be deemed a material violation for purposes of this section), then the Licensee shall pay The Mamba Company's reasonable cost of conducting such audit.

Upon expiry or termination of the Agreement, Licensee shall cease and shall cause all Designated Users (including those of its Affiliates’ and Contractors’) to cease using the Licensed Software and distribution of the Redistributables under this Agreement.<br><br>

Notwithstanding the above, in the event the Agreement expires or is terminated:<br><br>

Expiry or termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever shall not relieve Licensee of its obligation to pay any License Fees accrued or payable to The Mamba Company prior to the effective date of termination, and Licensee shall immediately pay to The Mamba Company all such fees upon the effective date of termination.

<h2>12.5.               Extension in case of bankruptcy</h2>

In the event The Mamba Company is declared bankrupt under a final, non-cancellable decision by relevant court of law, and this Agreement is not, at the date of expiry of the Development License(s) pursuant to Section 3.1, assigned to party, who has assumed The Mamba Company’s position as a legitimate licensor of Licensed Software under this Agreement, then all valid licenses possessed by the Licensee at such date of expiry, and which the Licensee has not notified for expiry, shall be extended to be valid in perpetuity under the terms of this Agreement.

Except in the case of a merger or sale of substantially all of its corporate assets, Licensee shall not be entitled to assign or transfer all or any of its rights, benefits and obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of The Mamba Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Mamba Company shall be entitled to freely assign or transfer any of its rights, benefits or obligations under this Agreement.
<h2>14.2.               No Third-Party Representations</h2>

Licensee shall make no representations or warranties concerning the Licensed Software on behalf of The Mamba Company. Any representation or warranty Licensee makes or purports to make on The Mamba Company’s behalf shall be void as to The Mamba Company.

Any terms and conditions that by their nature or otherwise reasonably should survive termination of this Agreement shall so be deemed to survive. Such sections include especially the following: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12.4, 13 and 14.   
<h2>14.4.               Entire Agreement</h2>

This Agreement, the exhibits hereto, the License Certificate and any applicable Purchase Order accepted by The Mamba Company constitute the complete agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous discussions, representations, and proposals, written or oral, with respect to the subject matters discussed herein.<br><br>

In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Agreement and any Purchase Order, the terms of this Agreement will prevail over the terms of the Purchase Order with respect to such conflict or inconsistency.<br><br>
